# IP_on_map_route_tracer
Python developed program to track and show route that packets take while travelling to selected IP address or website.

Geolocation data is based on ip2geotools and received from  DbIpCity. While not extremly precise, usable and free. But for better results should be used with paid database.

Google maps usage and ploting over it made with gmplot.
